<p style="font-family: monospace; margin: 10; font-size: 15px;">⭐ First Generation of Computers
Classification of generations of computers
The evolution of computer technology is often divided into five generations.
<br></br>
Five Generations of Computers
<br></br>
Generations of computers	Generations timeline	Evolving hardware
<br></br>
1. 	First generation	1940s-1950s	Vacuum tube based
<br></br>
2. Second generation	1950s-1960s	Transistor based
<br></br>
3. Third generation	1960s-1970s	Integrated circuit based
<br></br>
4. Fourth generation	1970s-present	Microprocessor based
<br></br>
5. Fifth generation	The present and the future	Artificial intelligence based
<br></br>
<br></br>

<br></br>
<br></br>
<p style="font-family: monospace; margin: 10; font-size: 15px;">1. Main electronic component – vacuum tube
<br></br>
2. Main memory – magnetic drums and magnetic tapes
<br></br>
3. Programming language – machine language
<br></br>
4. Power – consume a lot of electricity and generate a lot of heat.
<br></br>
5. Speed and size – very slow and very large in size (often taking up entire room).
<br></br>
6. Input/output devices – punched cards and paper tape.
<br></br>
Examples – ENIAC, UNIVAC1, IBM 650, IBM 701, etc.
<br></br>
Quantity – there were about 100 different vacuum tube computers produced between 1942 and1963.
<br></br>
📀 Second Generation of Computers
<br></br>
The main characteristics of second generation of computers (1950s-1960s)
<br></br>

<br></br>
SECOND GENERATION OF COMPUTER (1950-1960)
<br></br>
<br></br></center>
<p style="font-family: monospace; margin: 10; font-size: 15px;">1. Main electronic component – transistor
<br></br>
2. Memory – magnetic core and magnetic tape / disk
<br></br>
3. Programming language – assembly language
<br></br>
4. Power and size – low power consumption, generated less heat, and smaller in size (in comparison with the first generation computers).
<br></br>
5. Speed – improvement of speed and reliability (in comparison with the first generation computers).
<br></br>
6. Input/output devices – punched cards and magnetic tape.
<br></br>
Examples – IBM 1401, IBM 7090 and 7094, UNIVAC 1107, etc.
<br></br>
📀 Third Generation of Computers
<br></br>
The main characteristics of third generation of computers (1960s-1970s)
<br></br>
<br></br>

<center><img src="/storage/emulated/0/html/tg.jpg" width="30%" height="50%">
<br></br>
THIRD GENERATION OF COMPUTER (1960-1970)
<br></br>
<br></br>
</center>
<p style="font-family: monospace; margin: 10; font-size: 15px;">1. Main electronic component – integrated circuits (ICs)
<br></br>
2. Memory – large magnetic core, magnetic tape / disk
<br></br>
3. Programming language – high level language (FORTRAN, BASIC, Pascal, COBOL, C, etc.)
<br></br>
4. Size – smaller, cheaper, and more efficient than second generation computers (they were called minicomputers).
<br></br>
6. Speed – improvement of speed and reliability (in comparison with the second generation computers).
<br></br>
7. Input / output devices – magnetic tape, keyboard, monitor, printer, etc.
<br></br>
Examples – IBM 360, IBM 370, PDP-11, UNIVAC 1108, etc.
<br></br>
📀 Fourth Generation of Computers
<br></br>
1. The main characteristics of fourth generation of computers (1970s-present)
<br></br>
<br></br>

FOURTH GENERATION OF COMPUTER (1970-Present)
<br></br>
<br></br>
</center>
<p style="font-family: monospace; margin: 10; font-size: 15px;">2. Main electronic component – very large-scale integration (VLSI) and microprocessor.
<br></br>
3. VLSI– thousands of transistors on a single microchip.
<br></br>
4. Memory – semiconductor memory (such as RAM, ROM, etc.)
<br></br>
5. RAM (random-access memory) – a type of data storage (memory element) used in computers that temporary stores of programs and data (volatile: its contents are lost when the computer is turned off).
<br></br>
6. ROM (read-only memory) – a type of data storage used in computers that permanently stores data and programs (non-volatile: its contents are retained even when the computer is turned off).
<br></br>
7. Programming language – high level language (Python, C#, Java, JavaScript, Rust, Kotlin, etc.).
A mix of both third- and fourth-generation languages
<br></br>
8. Size – smaller, cheaper and more efficient than third generation computers.
<br></br>
9. Speed – improvement of speed, accuracy, and reliability (in comparison with the third generation computers).
<br></br>
10. Input / output devices – keyboard, pointing devices, optical scanning, monitor, printer, etc.
<br></br>
11. Network – a group of two or more computer systems linked together.
<br></br>
Examples – IBM PC, STAR 1000, APPLE II, Apple Macintosh, etc.
<br></br>
📀 Fifth Generation of Computers
<br></br>
1. The main characteristics of fifth generation of computers (the present and the future)
<br></br>
<br></br>

<p style="font-family: monospace; margin: 10; font-size: 15px;">2. Main electronic component: based on artificial intelligence, uses the Ultra Large-Scale Integration (ULSI) 
3. technology and parallel processing method.
<br></br>
4. ULSI – millions of transistors on a single microchip
<br></br>
5. Parallel processing method – use two or more microprocessors to run tasks simultaneously.
<br></br>
6. Language – understand natural language (human language).
<br></br>
7. Power – consume less power and generate less heat.
<br></br>
8. Speed – remarkable improvement of speed, accuracy and reliability (in comparison with the fourth generation computers).
<br></br>
9. Size – portable and small in size, and have a huge storage capacity.
<br></br>
10. Input / output device – keyboard, monitor, mouse, trackpad (or touchpad), touchscreen, pen, speech input (recognise voice / speech), light scanner, printer, etc.
<br></br>
Example – desktops, laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.
<br></br>
Three women sitting around a table with laptops.
<br></br>
The computer – this amazing technology went from a government/business-only technology to being everywhere from people’s homes, work places, to people’s pockets in less than 100 years.</p>
